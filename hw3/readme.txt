From the time I clicked run on the cell that executed my python script until step three showed "COMPLETED", it took around 13 minutes (13 minutes and 17 seconds based on my stopwatch)
According to the AWS EMR console, it only took 9 minutes.
Two nodes were used, MASTER and CORE, both of the m5.xlarge type
I spent roughly 6 hours on this from start to finish.
